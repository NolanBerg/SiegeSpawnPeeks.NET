# SiegeSpawnPeeks.NET

This is a new attempt at an old project of mine but with a way better ui! Last time I made this project with vanilla js and html/css. This time around I am using Vite and React!

It is a work in progress but the main page is getting there!

# How to use

# Clone Repository
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/NolanBerg/SiegeSpawnPeeks.NET.git

# Cd directory

cd SiegeSpawnPeeks.NET
```
# Install npm

npm install

# Run and copy address into preferred browser!
